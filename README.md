# Demo Offline App

This is a simple Ruby on Rails app to show how a service worker can be used to pre-cache pages and display them offline. The app also shows an offline fallback for a page that is explicitly not cached by the service worker.

**Note** Service workers are complicated so please use this demo for ideas and nothing more. A real life example of a sophisticated offline capable Rails app is the [Rails World Conference App](https://github.com/TelosLabs/rails-world).
